#+TITLE: Loco's Dotfiles

* Installation

#+begin_src 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/locojay/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh bootstrap.sh
#+end_src


* Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with
the following command.

#+begin_src language
sudo brew install zsh
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
#+end_src

* Update
#+begin_src 
git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src
