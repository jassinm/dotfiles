2013-12-15 13:05:58	erliphant	Hi all - how would you construct a large binary efficiently (eg. for testing). The approaches I've tried are very slow.
2013-12-15 13:06:20	essen	<< 0:80000000000000000 >>
2013-12-15 13:06:48	erliphant	Nice. Thanks essen - I'll give it a try. TVM!
2013-12-15 13:07:00	essen	size is in bits and you'll probably want it smaller

2013-12-15 15:47:18	Dynasty	so lets say that my main app launches one server... some players start to connect and pretty soon the server is full. When the server is full the main app launches another server running on a different port so that more players can join
2013-12-15 15:47:36	Dynasty	now lets say for example that we want a plugin to control the fog color

2013-12-15 15:48:24	DeadZen	what is a server in this example.
2013-12-15 15:48:57	DeadZen	another erlang vm on the same computer?

2013-12-15 15:49:13	Dynasty	no, it's the same erlang vm
2013-12-15 15:49:21	Dynasty	or maybe another erlang vm on another node
2013-12-15 15:49:32	DeadZen	but the servers are already running..
2013-12-15 15:49:50	DeadZen	and you just want to start another 32 person limited world with a separate day/night
2013-12-15 15:50:01	DeadZen	in each selected servers vm
2013-12-15 15:50:26	Dynasty	they are on the same vm

2013-12-15 15:50:37	DeadZen	right and in the same application
2013-12-15 15:50:48	DeadZen	ok you can still launch more servers in that application
2013-12-15 15:50:53	DeadZen	and have plugins as separate applications
2013-12-15 15:51:48	DeadZen	your main app will say i need to start another server, the server will say i need these plugins to run, your app will say, heres the commands to start plugins for your server, have fun
2013-12-15 15:52:15	DeadZen	commands to start could be simple here's the supervisor spec to run under your supervisor:start_child
2013-12-15 15:53:38	Dynasty	okay but do the plugins run under the main app or a separate plugin app
2013-12-15 15:54:46	DeadZen	theres another alternate for the application .app called {included_applications, ..} http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/included_applications.html .. but you could also get away with it all under one application..
2013-12-15 15:55:33	DeadZen	with that approach it won't make a huge difference, since plugins cannot exist by themselves it's fine to include them in the application I think

2013-12-15 16:00:39	DeadZen	Dynasty: erlang supports automatic code swapping of non local calls
2013-12-15 16:01:23	DeadZen	so all calls to plugin:blah or ?MODULE:blah will (inside plugin), but blah() by itself no
2013-12-15 16:01:50	DeadZen	if you need more structured live code changes, you use a release upgrade
