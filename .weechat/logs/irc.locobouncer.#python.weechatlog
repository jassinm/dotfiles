2013-12-19 21:57:05	fluter	bpalmer, self.s is a intance variable, right?
2013-12-19 21:57:26	fluter	why self? it's a class member, not a instance one,
2013-12-19 21:57:34	nedbat	fluter: self.x will look on the instance, and then on the class if need be.
2013-12-19 21:57:39	bpalmer	fluter: it says look up s as an attribute of self. First it looks for an instance variable, then it looks to class variables.
2013-12-19 21:57:50	fluter	ah, okay
2013-12-19 21:57:55	fluter	thanks bpalmer nedbat
2013-12-19 21:58:01	nedbat	fluter: for example, that's why you can invoke methods on self:  self.method(),  method is a class attribute.
2013-12-19 21:58:03	bpalmer	and using self.s  for this sort of thing does let you override it in subclasses.

It's a relatively common pattern to have a dictionary of strings to functions, you go commands = {"foo": foo, "bar": bar}; def execute(command, *args, **kwargs): commands[command](*args, **kwargs); then you can get certain functions called from the outside world without the terror of exec.

2013-12-20 06:10:53	Abhijit	acharya, we have latest version of the python programming language. this version do "not" have backward compatibility with everything. so old libraries or plugins ol modules or 3rd party api created to work with python version 2 do not work with python version 3. so you can start your open source contribution by learning what are those new changes in python version 3 and how to port old libraries from version 2 to 3, and then actualy porting them.

2013-12-20 06:40:38	Yhg1s	WuaccaWuacca: it's not clear to me what you're trying to do with these very, very nested dicts (nested dicts is usually a mistake), but you may want to use a copy of genderDict in your creation of frequencyDict.

2013-12-20 06:41:17	Yhg1s	WuaccaWuacca: that's not how dictionaries work. Dictionaries store objects. Everything in Python is a reference, so the dicts just store references to objects. You have multiple references to the same dict ('genderDict') in your frequencyDict.

2013-12-20 07:59:38	Yhg1s	winmutt: you can execute things through a setuid interpreter --which you could do with Python as well -- but it doesn't change how the kernel behaves with setuid script.
2013-12-20 07:59:54	Yhg1s	winmutt: taint-tracking is fairly orthogonal to setuid.

2013-12-20 10:01:20	Yhg1s	Wessie: yes, no, maybe. It depends on the class, and the platform, and the timing. If a new worker is forked on platforms with fork, nothing is copied. If it's passed to an existing worker, or the platform has no fork, the class is pickled. Whether that copies things depends on the class.

2013-12-20 15:28:28	tsmithe	dash, objects that are more than just structs (ie, constructors, destructors, dynamic memory) fits the bill here. C doesn't have that by default, but C++ and python do. anyway, that is really by the by. my point was only to say that going via C is very by-the-by

2013-12-20 21:25:29	JamesNZ	This error is coming from __init__.py which just imports bots.

2013-12-20 21:43:29	johnmaguire2013	then a plugin could import CardinalPlugin from cardinal.plugin

2013-12-20 21:44:42	ssbr	if you want to take advantage of the GPU, you can either use pygame and throw away all the graphics bits, or not use pygame. Either one works pretty well.

2013-12-21 13:14:45	ellipsis753	Hello. I have a lot of screenshots of me scrolling around a list and am hoping to stitch them together into one large image. Is there a way for PIL to quickly find any regions (or at least the largest region) that two images have in common? (Each screenshot overlaps partly with the last, I need to know how they overlap so I can paste them together). Thank you.

2013-12-23 10:11:10	vortec	hi, I'm having trouble understanding the unichr() function. when i call unichr(160), i get u"\xa0' back, which is correct. when i call unichr(2007) however, i get back u"\u07d7". why is that? why not u”\u2007"? when i print u"\u07d7", i get a completely unrelated character, and not the character i expect (figure space)

2013-12-23 12:19:43	cwillu_at_work	mateNz, it's about how many _more_ cycles a task takes as the size of the task grows

2013-12-23 19:03:45	Yhg1s	mcfundash: you can just use 'globalvar' in your function.
2013-12-23 19:03:50	buck1	use it.
2013-12-23 19:03:52	Yhg1s	mcfundash: no need to pass it in, no need to declare it global.
2013-12-23 19:04:08	buck1	mcfundash: for *reading* a global var, you dont need either one

2013-12-23 19:05:29	buck1	mcfundash: you seem confused.
2013-12-23 19:05:33	mcfundash	what if I just do localvar = globalvar
2013-12-23 19:05:40	buck1	then you have a local var...
2013-12-23 19:05:44	Yhg1s	mcfundash: that may or may not be what you want. It depend son what you want.
2013-12-23 19:05:46	Yhg1s	mcfundash: what do you want?
2013-12-23 19:05:50	mcfundash	and then I do all operations on localvar
2013-12-23 19:06:07	mcfundash	to grab a global variable, and then manipulate it inside the function
2013-12-23 19:06:10	Yhg1s	mcfundash: what kind of operations are we talking about? Are you mutating the object, or just reassigning the name?
2013-12-23 19:06:16	buck1	mcfundash: if you mutate the *insides* of that variable, it will be seen globally
2013-12-23 19:06:18	Yhg1s	mcfundash: what type of object is it? What does 'manipulate' it entail?
2013-12-23 19:06:29	Yhg1s	buck1: there is no such thing as 'the insides of a variable'.
2013-12-23 19:06:36	Yhg1s	mcfundash: bit.ly/pynames may be of assistance.
2013-12-23 19:06:37	mcfundash	just performing operations on it
2013-12-23 19:06:43	Yhg1s	mcfundash: yes, but _what kind_ of operations?
2013-12-23 19:06:49	buck1	mcfundash: i think this is related; http://stackoverflow.com/a/20713959/146821
2013-12-23 19:06:50	mcfundash	math
2013-12-23 19:06:51	Yhg1s	mcfundash: the details matter.
2013-12-23 19:06:55	mcfundash	ok
2013-12-23 19:06:56	Yhg1s	mcfundash: ok, so this is an integer, or what?
2013-12-23 19:07:01	mcfundash	yes
2013-12-23 19:07:10	Yhg1s	mcfundash: then 'localname = globalname' is probably what you want.
2013-12-23 19:07:10	mcfundash	actually no a list
2013-12-23 19:07:14	mcfundash	ok
2013-12-23 19:07:22	Yhg1s	mcfundash: if it's a list, that's probably not what you want.
2013-12-23 19:07:23	mcfundash	thats what I was thinking
2013-12-23 19:07:35	Yhg1s	mcfundash: I suggest you start by reading bit.ly/pynames
2013-12-23 19:07:39	mcfundash	I need to do this in two functions, one with a list one with an integer
2013-12-23 19:08:04	Yhg1s	mcfundash: then you'll probably have to write code differently, but it depends on which oeprations you want to do on the list. http://bit.ly/pynames explains.

2013-12-24 08:07:43	Yhg1s	rockybanana: it's called 'arbitrary attributes'.
2013-12-24 08:08:05	Yhg1s	rockybanana: anything that doesn't explicitly disallow arbitrary attributes has them. 'object' disallows them, as do some builtin types.

2013-12-24 10:14:36	d33tah	cwillu_borken: well, i like to be able to deploy the same code to servers, regrrdless of whether they use py2.6, py2.7 or 3.3.
2013-12-24 10:14:39	gumble	I am filtering my mails for 2 informations. 1. The Date, 2. The Time I worked on that day. I want to sum up how many hours I worked in a month. So I always have 2 vars per mail, date (which is like "dec", "nov" or somrthing) and time_worked (a number) how can I sort the time_worked by date?? Something I would do in php like this; $array[$date] += $worked_time (assoziative array)
2013-12-24 10:14:52	ikanobori	fission6: Maybe you should look at it in a different way.
2013-12-24 10:15:04	ikanobori	Say, "I want just the characters that I care for (numbers, dots)"
2013-12-24 10:15:04	fission6	in what  way
2013-12-24 10:15:11	cwillu_borken	d33tah, even though that code will be interpreted very differently
2013-12-24 10:15:14	cwillu_borken	as I said, crazy :p
2013-12-24 10:15:29	ikanobori	Or maybe you just want the last 4 characters of a string.
2013-12-24 10:15:29	ikanobori	I don't know exactly you want.
2013-12-24 10:15:30	cwillu_borken	I don't doubt that you do it though
2013-12-24 10:15:43	fission6	yes i agree, there is room for that, but for now i just want to understand how to stripe u'\xa'
2013-12-24 10:15:43	fission6	for the sak eof knowing
2013-12-24 10:15:58	d33tah	cwillu_borken: not that "very"
2013-12-24 10:16:02	fission6	maybe my question is what is u'\xa'
2013-12-24 10:16:07	cwillu_borken	gumble, what is time_worked right now?

2013-12-24 10:16:46	fission6	ahhh i got it
2013-12-24 10:16:48	fission6	its strip(u'\xa3')

2013-12-24 10:17:26	cwillu_borken	d33tah, imports work differently, strings work differently, libraries are moved around, various functions work differently
2013-12-24 10:17:38	fission6	yep
2013-12-24 10:17:41	cwillu_borken	you can hide lots of this with libraries and/or by using less of the language
2013-12-24 10:17:53	\u03b5	ikanobori: \xa is an erroneous escape, \x0a is \n
2013-12-24 10:17:54	gumble	cwillu_borken:  atm it are two seperate variables. I am doing a for mail in mails and then filter out worked_time and date... for your idea they'd have to be in an object right?
2013-12-24 10:17:58	cwillu_borken	much like you can write code that compiles in c and c++
2013-12-24 10:18:23	cwillu_borken	gumble, that seems unlikely
2013-12-24 10:18:44	cwillu_borken	gumble, do you mean {"date": some_date, "time": some_time}?
2013-12-24 10:19:04	cwillu_borken	or do you have two lists:  dates=[...] and times=[...]?
