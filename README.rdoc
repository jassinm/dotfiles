== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  sh bootstrap.sh

== Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with
the following command.

  sudo brew install zsh
  chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
